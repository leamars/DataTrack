# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to my DataCamp track proposal. This was an interesting and thought-provoking exercise that took quite a while to complete. I'll briefly walk you through my process of approaching the task and why I decided to pick Algorithms & Data Structures as my final track proposal.

# Research
First, I reviewed the material you sent over and took a couple of DataCamp courses to get a good feel for their structure, content and pace.

After that I had a bit of a brainstorm on what I thought was missing from the core curriculum, based on my research and my background as an iOS Engineer, Product Manager and Educator. Ultimately I identified 3 key tracks that could benefit your curriculum:

* Product Analyst Career Track
* Get Ready for Production
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* DBT

# Design

Because I know that your learners struggle with being "real-world ready", I initially really wanted to create a practical track. One that was either geared towards what a data scientist at a tech company *really* does in their day-to-day:
* Finding patterns in user logs for bot detection
* Evaluating product initiatives against each-other based on cost vs value
* Writing and maintaining logs on clients
* Suggesting, facilitating, monitoring and interpreting experiments
* Working with 3rd party tools
* Investigating suspicious experiment results from 3rd party tools
* Identifying anomalies in core user funnels and finding explanations
* Helping others interpret data and creating visualizations and reports to promote data literacy

On the other hand, I was also upset that many DataCampers on Slack felt like they didn't learn enough from DataCamp to find a job in data. I've seen a couple of my friends struggle with this as well, so I felt compelled to construct a track to give learners the real-world experience needed to work:
* Reading documentation
* Writing documentation
* Writing "Pythonic" code
* Using Github (extensively)
* Using and understanding APIs
* Building your own APIs
* Debugging
* Publishing a portfolio
* Working with real-time data

DBT seemed like a great topic to cover, but I knew I couldn't do it justice in this amount of time. 

# Deliver
Ultimately I chose to focus on the Algorithms and Data Structures track, because:
* There is so much hidden under the hood in highly optimized Python packages that it's easy to never think about algorithms and data structures, but this foundational knowledge is necessary for writing fast and performant code
* Algorithms and Data Structures seem to be on the rise for data engineering and data science interviews
* When I tried sketching out the others within the boundaries of the DataCamp platform, they fell a bit flat
* I had little time, but enough experience in the topic to deliver it to my satisfaction

# Disclaimer
Data science is not in my wheelhouse of expertise. 

* I have a CS degree which allows me to quickly onboard to new programming languages, concepts and paradigms. 
* I've worked as a Product Manager, which has enabled me to understand what is needed of a data team in small, medium and large tech organizations and how they holistically support the product and tech strategy of a company. 
* I've also worked as an educator for over 10 years, most notably writing tutorials, publishing courses and editing books at [https://www.raywenderlich.com/](https://www.raywenderlich.com/), so I have considerable experience in delivering effective educational content. 

If you need an expert in data science for this role, I'm not the person you're looking for. But, if you need someone who has a solid background in a lot of related areas, who can learn fast and is excited about education and the transformative potential of data literacy and fluency... look no further (:

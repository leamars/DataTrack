## Course Title
Derived Data Types and Operations

## Course Prerequisites: 
* [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-in-python)

## Course Description
We're kicking things off with the basics. In this course, you will learn about Stacks, Queues and Linked Lists; the building blocks for the advanced data types you're more likely to use. These data types and their common operations are the simple foundations to understanding complex problems like searching through Trees and Graphs.

#### Learning Objectives
* Learner will be able to differentiate between Stacks, Queues and Linked Lists and recognize when it's appropriate to use them
* Learner will be able to construct a Linked List and Node class to create a Linked List data structure
* Learner will be able to understand the mechanics and complexity of common operations like adding and removing items and apply them to practical problems

## Course Proposal

### Chapter 1: Derived Data Types

#### Lessons
1. [Video] What are deriverd data types?
2. [Exercise] Match data types with time complexities
3. [Exercise] Identify the data type that fits the problem

#### Learning Objectives
1. Learner will be able to describe 3 basic derived data types; Stacks, Queues and Linked Lists
2. Learner will be able to evaluate which data type (Stack, Queue or Linked List) is the apporpriate representation for a real world scenario (Amusement park ride, Ice cream scoops, Travel directions)
3. Learner will be able to describe the strategies for inserting and removing from a Stack, Queue and Linked List

### Chapter 2: Stacks and Common Opperations

#### Lessons
1. [Video] Stack implementation and common operations: pop, push and peek
2. [Exercise] Exploring the Stack with pop, push and peek
3. [Exercise] Reverse an Array
4. [Exercise] Matching parentheses 

#### Learning Objectives
1. Learner will be able to explain time complexities for pop, push and peek in a Stack
2. Learner will be able to apply their knowledge of Stacks to solve two common algorithmic problems, reversing an Array and matching parentheses

### Chapter 3: Linked Lists and Operations
1. [Video] Linked List implementation and common operations: adding and removing values
2. [Exercise] Explore the Linked List
3. [Exercise] Adding to the front, back and anywhere in between
4. [Exercise] Find the middle

1. Learner will be able to explain time complexities for different adding and removing operations in a Linked List
2. Learner will be able to visualize adding and removing operations with nodes and pointers
3. Learner will be able to find the middle value of a Linked List, a common Linked List algorithmic problem

### Chapter 4: Queues and Operations
1. [Video] Queue implementations and common operations; enqueue and dequeue
2. [Exercise] Exploring the Queue with enqueue and dequeue
3. [Exercise] List and Linked List based Queue
4. [Exercise] Double Stack Queue

1. Learner will be able to explain time complexities for enqueing and dequeuing in a Queue
2. Learner will be able to describe the trade-offs of different Queue implementations based on a List, Linked List and Double Stack
3. Learner will be able to choose the appropriate data type to efficiently solve an algorithmic problem

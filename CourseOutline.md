Sketch an outline of one of the courses you would put in that track.
A course outline contains a list of four chapters, which each contain 3 - 4 lessons. Each
lesson should have a clearly stated learning objective. Save this outline as
CourseOutline.md in your GitHub repo. Please see below for more details.

Course Outline
* A course outline has four chapters, each of which has a descriptive name.
* Chapter 1 has three lessons and Chapters 2 - 4 each have 3 or 4 lessons.
* Each lesson has at least one specific, measurable learning objective. Each learning
objective begins with “Learner will be able to...” and uses a verb from the following
list (connected to levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy):

* The ordering of lessons is optimized for learner engagement and narrative
coherence.
* The course outline is sufficiently detailed to prove that the course will satisfy the
learning objective stated in the Skill Track.
* The course outline is not reflective of an existing course.
* The course can be completed in about 4 hours by a learner of appropriate skill
level.
* Here’s an example of a completed outline.

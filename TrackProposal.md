# Track Proposal

## Track Title
Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

## Track Description

As Python developers, we often rely on prebuilt packages such as NumPy and pandas to wrangle and inspect data. But how much do you actually know about the underlying efficiency and complexity of the code that underpin them? In this course, you will learn how to analyse your code's efficiency, and how to pick the right data type for solving your problem. You will learn about common algorithms for sorting and searching as well as techniques for greedy and dynamic programming. Never get stumped wondering how well your code works again!

## Track Outline
1. Algorithms, Data Structures and Complexity
2. Built in Data Types
3. Derived Data Types and Operations
4. Advanced Data Types: Trees, Binary Trees and Binary Search
5. Advanced Data Types: Heaps, Graphs, BFS and DFS
6. Sorting Algorithms

## Course Descriptions

### Algorithms, Data Structures and Complexity

#### Prerequisites: 
* [Intermediate Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python)

#### Marketing Description
Most Python developers can make their code "work", but, how many can make their code work well? In this course you will learn how to analyze the complexity of your code with regards to time and space, to produce faster and more efficient code!

#### Learning Objectives
* Learner will be able to recognize and evaluate common Big O notiations such as O(1), O(n), O(n^2), O(log*n), O(n*log*n).
* Learner will be able to analyze code to compare and contrast various solutions for time complexity.
* Learner will be able to analyze code to compare and contrast various solutions for space complexity.

### Built-in Data Types
This course would consist of half of the [Data Type for Data Science in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/data-types-for-data-science-in-python) course, and expand on it.

#### Prerequisites: 
* [Intermediate Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python)

#### Marketing Description
Have you got your basic Python programming chops down for Data Science but are yearning for more? Then this is the course for you. Herein, you'll consolidate and practice your knowledge of lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets.

#### Learning Objectives
* Learner will be able to create, store and loop over data by using the fundamental Python data types - lists, tuples and sets.
* Learner will be able to store, access, add and remove to a dictionary by exploring the New York Baby Names dataset.
* Learner will be able to use the Counter, defaultdict, OrderedDict and namedtuple in the context of answering questions about the Chicago transit dataset.

### Derived Data Types and Operations
#### Prerequisites: 
* [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-in-python)
* Built-in Data Types

#### Marketing Description
We're kicking things off with the basics. In this course, you will learn about Stacks, Queues and Linked Lists; the building blocks for the advanced data types you're more likely to use. These data types and their common operations provide the foundation to understanding complex problems such as searching through Trees and Graphs.

#### Learning Objectives
* Learner will be able to differentiate between Stacks, Queues and Linked Lists, recognizing when and how to use them.
* Learner will be able to construct a Linked List and Node class to create a Linked List data structure.
* Learner will be able to understand the mechanics and complexity of common operations like push, pop, peek and insert and practically apply them to a parsing problem.

### Advanced Data Types: Trees, Binary Trees and Binary Search

#### Prerequisites: 
* Derived Data Types and Operations

### Marketing Description
Basic data structures are great building blocks, but are often used only for basic problems. When you want to address problems, like finding your way out of a maze as quick as possible, you will need something more advanced - a Tree! In this course you will master the fundamentals of Tree terminology and learn about the complexity benefits and drawbacks of Trees versus Lists and other data types.

#### Learning Objectives
* Learner will become comfortable using Tree terminology such as parent, child, leaf and root by looking at diagrams and performing manual insertion and deletion.
* Learner will be able to distinguish a Binary Tree and articulate its advantages in algorithmic complexity over a non-Binary Tree in operations like search and sort.
* Learner will be able to recognize the benefits and drawbacks in time complexity for Binary Search Trees vs Lists for common operations like insert, remove and contain.

### Advanced Data Types: Heaps, Graphs, BFS and DFS
#### Prerequisites: 
* Advanced Data Types: Trees, Binary Trees and Binary Search

#### Marketing Description
Likely the most relevant data structures for data scientists are graphs, allowing us to model relationships between objects. In this course, you will learn about graphs, heaps and two famous search techniques - BFS (breadth-first-search) and DFS (depth-first-search).

#### Learning Objectives
* Learner will be able to articulate the time and space complexity of the Heap data structure and manually perform (draw) insertion, removal and heapify operations.
* Learner will become comfortable using graph terminology like edge, vertex and degree and able to manually build them from an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.
* Learner will be able to explain what BFS (breadth-first-search) and DFS (depth-first-search) are and apply them appropriately to example scenarios like winning chess and finding the fastest way to the bus stop. 

### Sorting Algorithms

#### Prerequisites: 
* Advanced Data Types: Heaps, Graphs, BFS and DFS

#### Marketing Description
Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science because they create order from disorder, allowing you to process neatly sorted data with ease. In this course you'll learn about some basic sorting algorithms like Bubble, Selection and Insertion sort and why you should probably never user them. Additionally you will also learn about two more popular sorting techniques; merge sort and quick sort and how to implement them.

#### Learning Objectives
* Learner will be able to choose an appropriate sorting algorithm for a given data set based on sample exercises and complexity analysis.
* Learner will be able to explain simple sorting algorithms like bubble, selection and insertion sort through visualizations
* Learner will become familiar with the implementation of quick sort and merge sort, by filling in the gaps of their functions through exercises.

### Common Algorithmic Approaches

#### Prerequisites: 
* Sorting Algorithms

#### Marketing Description

#### Learning Objectives
* Learner will be able to categorize sample problems to appropriate algorithmic approaches, choosing between dynamic programming, greedy algorithm and divide & conquer.
* Learner will be able to connect the sorting algorithms from the previous course to the algorithmic approaches from this exercises, understanding that insertion sort is an example of dynamic programming, selection sort is an example of greedy algorithms, and merge sort and quick sort are examples of divide and conquer.

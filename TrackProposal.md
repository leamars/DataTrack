As part of the interview process, we ask that you :

Create a track proposal in one of the following curriculum areas:

* Data Engineering
* Machine Learning
* Finance
* Reporting

Please make sure to focus on Python, SQL, or R in your track proposal. While your track
proposal may include a few existing courses, the course outline you create should not be
based on an existing course.

A track is a collection of 6 - 8 coursesthat yield specific learning outcomes around a specific
topic, tool, technique, or model. Save this proposal as TrackProposal.md in your GitHub repo.
Please see below for more details.

Track
● Track has clear learning objectives that would be relevant to a working
professional in data science or data engineering.
● Track contains proposals for 6 - 8 courses.

● Each proposed course has a brief marketing description that would engage a
potential learner.
● Each proposed course has 2 - 3 specific, measurable learning objectives.
● Required prerequisites from DataCamp (if any are necessary) are clearly stated
and briefly justified.
● The track outline is not reflective of an existing track.
● Here’s an example of a track on time series analysis.

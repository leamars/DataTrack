3. Create a sample exercise for the corresponding course.
A sample exercise is a short code snippet (approximately 5 - 10 lines of code and 4 - 5
lines of code comments) with blanksthat learners will fill in based on 2 - 4 bulleted
instructions. Save this exercise as SampleExercise.md in your GitHub repo.

Sample Exercise
* The exercise has 3 - 4 sentences of “Context” which engages the learner and
explains why they are doing this exercise.
* The exercise has 2 - 4 bulleted instructions. Each instruction is a complete
sentence that describes a specific task (usually a single line of code that the learner
must write).
* The solution code is no more than 15 lines of code (including 4 - 5 lines of code
comments and any necessary line breaks).
* The sample exercise assesses one or two measurable learning objectives.

## Sample Exercise
Matching Parentheses

## Context
Mismatched closing parentheses, brackets or quotes are one of the most common syntax errors when programming in Python.

They're easy to forget and deviously hard to find with the naked eye, especially in longer chunks of code.

`Input : {[]{()}}
Output : Balanced

Input : [{}{}(]
Output : Unbalanced`
